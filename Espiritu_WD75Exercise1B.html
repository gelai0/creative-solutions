    <h1>What is Hypertext</h1>

    <p>
        Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hypertext is text which contains 
        <a href="#">links</a> to other texts.The term was coined by
        <a href="#">Ted Nelson</a> around 1965 (see 
        <a href="#">History</a> ).
    </p>

    <p>
        HyperMedia is a  term used for hypertext which  is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and 
        <a href="#">sound</a> , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.
